Manachar Algorithm lc5

cycle detection using bfs or dfs 
any acyclic graph is a bipartite graph 
cyclic graph with even cyclic length is bipartite
topological sort


prims algo: undirected weighted graph st for n nodes there should be n-1 edges
in this we try to remove max weight edges to make that min spanning tree

Shortest Dist: Bellman FOrd algo and Dijkstra 
Bellman Ford: directed adv is -ve cycle detect kr deta. In this we have to from edge list for finding -ve cycle n-1 tk loop chalao uske bad ik aur looopp chalao agar dist kam hua then -ve cycle aaa usmei
Dijkstra: directed , undirected In this we have to from adj list
